# Desat

## Decentralized Community-Driven Ordinals and Atomicals Protocol Trading Platform

Desat is a decentralized community-driven platform for trading Ordinals and Atomicals protocol tokens. This product is collectively owned and driven by the community, utilizing cutting-edge technology to facilitate fast buying and selling on the Bitcoin network. Additionally, it introduces exclusive token incentives in the industry trading platform.

## Project Features

Existing trading platforms in the industry typically support only one protocol, Desat takes the lead by supporting both BRC20 and ARC20 protocols. Furthermore, unlike other platforms where all service fee revenue from BRC20 and ARC20 transactions belongs to the platform, Desat ensures that 100% of the platform fee income goes back to the community. This embodies the spirit of community-driven, fair sharing inspired by the principles of Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.

 ### 1. Industry's first trading platform supporting both ARC20 and BRC20 protocols
 
Desat stands out as the first trading platform in the industry to support both ARC20 and BRC20 protocols, allowing users to trade tokens of both protocols on the Desat platform.

### 2. Community ownership of fee income

In contrast to other existing trading platforms, Desat allocates all collected fees directly to the community. Various roles contributing to the community will share in the revenue. Of this income, 60% will be distributed to community developers and operators, ensuring that those who contribute to the development and maintenance of the platform are duly rewarded. Additionally, 10% of the income will be used to repurchase Desat platform tokens, which will then be burned. The remaining 30% will be utilized for order placement rewards, incentivizing community users to participate in platform orders and transactions.

### 3. Adoption of industry-standard trading fees

Desat adopts the common practice of charging trading fees prevalent in the industry, aside from gas fees. The platform service fee is set at the standard rate. Considering that many BRC20 and ARC20 transactions occur off-chain, Desat, as a decentralized community-driven platform, aims to be a reliable trading method trusted by both buyers and sellers.

### 4.Powerful features, pioneering K-line charts, and rewards functionality

Desat offers robust features including decentralized order placement services, trading systems, an index module, and market display systems. Setting itself apart from other trading platforms, Desat is the first to introduce K-line charts, enabling users to monitor trading volume, price fluctuations, and other factors on an hourly or daily basis for investment strategy analysis. Moreover, it introduces an exclusive community reward function to incentivize community users to participate in platform orders and transactions.

### 5.Platform token with practical applications, buyback, and burn for deflation

Platform fees will be used to repurchase and burn Desat platform tokens, aligning with the concept of deflation to endow Desat platform tokens with anticipated value. All repurchased tokens will be burned until deflation is achieved.
